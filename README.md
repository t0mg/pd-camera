# PD-Camera project

PD-Camera is an unofficial, experimental accessory for Panic's [Playdate](https://play.date) handheld console, which as the name hopefully suggests allows the device to record pictures as well as animated gifs, in whopping  1-bit color and QVGA (320x240) resolution. Kind of like the [1998 accessory for that other monochrome handheld device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera).

For more context on how this project came along, you can find its devlog [on Playdate's Dev forum](https://devforum.play.date/t/playdate-oneil-camera/11043/28).

This repository contains the hardware and firmware of the PD-Camera accessory. The source for the companion app that runs on the Playdate itself _will eventually_ be found [here](https://github.com/t0mg/pd-camera).

## Hardware

The project is based on a [Teensy 4.1 microcontroller](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy41.html) that acts as a USB host to the Playdate and communicates with it over serial, including evaluating payloads in the Lua runtime (see [here](https://github.com/jaames/playdate-reverse-engineering/blob/main/usb/usb.md) for more details). The Teensy is also connected to an OV7670 camera module via its CMOS Sensor Interface (CSI) built into the IMXRT1062 MPU and using [this dedicated library](https://github.com/mjborgerson/OV7670).

A battery, custom PCB and a custom 3D-printable case complete the hardware (gerber and stl files _will eventually be_ provided in this repository).

For the detailed bill of material and assembly instructions, hop over to the [hardware folder](/hardware/).

## Firmware

To flash the Teensy microcontroller with the project's firmware, you'll need the [Teensy loader application](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html). 

If you don't want to modify the source, you can directly grab a prebuilt `firmware.hex` file from the repository's [releases](https://github.com/t0mg/pd-camera/releases). Otherwise, read on to build your own.

### Building

This project uses [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) to manage dependencies and build toolchain, see [platformio.ini](platformio.ini).

The source code comprises a single, messy, [main.cpp](src/main.cpp) file which relies the following excellent libraries:

  -	[USBHost_t36](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/USBHost_t36) by [PaulStoffregen](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen)
  - [OV7670](https://github.com/mjborgerson/OV7670) by [mjborgerson](https://github.com/mjborgerson)
